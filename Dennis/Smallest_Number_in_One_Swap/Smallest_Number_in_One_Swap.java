/*
Given a non-negative number N. The task is to apply at most one swap operation on the number N so that the resultant is the smallest possible number.

Note: Input and Output should not contain leading zeros.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a number N as input.

Output:
For each test case, print the smallest number possible. if it is not possible to make smallest number than N then print N as it is.

Constraints:
1<=T<=300
2<=|Number length |<=105

Example:
Input:
2
9625635
3268

Output:
2695635
2368
